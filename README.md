# Automatic Formal Verification Tool
- Master thesis for EIT Autonomous Systems Course at University of Trento
- Makes use of a vision ontology to generate specifications in Con_spec (a logical specification language)
- Automatically verifies CLIP model based on RIVAL10 dataset as sample

Based on [Concept-based Analysis of Neural Networks via Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.19837v1)
